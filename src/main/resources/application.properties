# When enabled, will generate test responses when audio is received

# Conversation Configuration
# Silence timeout in milliseconds - wait this long after user stops speaking before processing
# Default: 1500ms (1.5 seconds)
# Note: This timeout only counts time since LAST AUDIO WITH ENERGY (not silence chunks)
conversation.silence.timeout.ms=1500

# Audio Energy Detection Configuration
# Minimum RMS energy threshold to consider audio as speech (not silence)
# Lower values = more sensitive (detects quieter speech)
# Higher values = more strict (filters out background noise when mic is off)
# Default: 120.0 - balanced to detect real speech while filtering constant noise
# If user speech still not detected, try lowering to 100.0 or 80.0
# If mic-off audio is detected as speech, increase to 150.0 or 200.0
audio.energy.threshold=120.0

# Minimum percentage of non-silence samples required to consider as speech
# Default: 20% - at least 20% of samples must have energy above threshold
# Lower values = more sensitive (detects quieter speech)
# Higher values = more strict (requires more of the chunk to have energy)
# If user speech not detected, try lowering to 15.0 or 10.0
audio.energy.min.non.silence.percent=20.0
